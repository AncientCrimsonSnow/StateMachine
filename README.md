# README for StateMachine Repository

## Overview
This repository contains the complete Unity project used for developing and testing the StateMachine package, implementing a Hierarchical State Machine (HSM).

### What is a Hierarchical State Machine (HSM)?
A Hierarchical State Machine (HSM) is an advanced state management system where states can have sub-states, forming a tree structure. This allows for more complex and scalable state management compared to a flat finite state machine (FSM). HSMs are particularly useful for game development, enabling nested states and inherited behaviors.
